>WARNING: For a project to qualify as a submission, it must be discoverable using the Mandatory GitHub Topics. See [repo requirements](./repo-requirements.md).


### 1) GitHub Repo Link
Each team is to appoint 1 person to create the team's [**GitHub](https://github.com/)**  repo and share the access with the team to collaborate on. During submissions, the team needs to submit the link to this GitHub Repo which will be accessible to the judges.

* GitHub repo should host the application’s code and any other deployment files and testing instructions.

### 2) Project Description
This is a detailed description of your team's project containing an overview of what problem is being addressed, what is the WOW factor of the idea and how do you think its fundable.

It should include the following:

* Name and summary of the project
* Names/pseudonyms of team members and contact information (e.g. GitHub handle, email address, etc)
* The category of submission
* An overview of what problem is being addressed
* How the project uses Substrate or other technology

### 3) 2 minute Pitch Video
>Note: Judges will not judge any content over the 2:00 minute mark! (i.e. anything from 2:01 onward WILL NOT be elgibile for judging)
This is a video recording of your team introducing your project and solution (as though you are in front of a live audience pitching in a physical hackathon!)

The video recording can be done over platforms like Zoom, Google Meets, etc. with the entire team present in the recording, if possible. Videos should be uploaded on YouTube, Google Drive, etc. and the link should be provided during submission.

The judges will stop looking at the video beyond 3 minutes, thus it will be advisable to keep the pitch video under 3 minutes with the WOW factor clearly highlighted.

The pitch video should mention:

* Name of your project and a brief overview of what it does
* The identified issue and how your project is able to tackle the problem
* A brief demonstration of the prototype and the use of technology/application involved
